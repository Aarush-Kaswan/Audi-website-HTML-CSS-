				<h1>The formula for progress</h1>
				<p>During our video call, Dr. Karl Durst waves his cup of coffee around with a wry smile: “Basically I could illustrate our work very well with this cup. The cup needs to satisfy various requirements: It needs to hold 0.3 liters of liquid, you need to be able to hold it with one hand and it needs to keep the liquid hot for a while. It’s the same with a vehicle: Every Audi needs to satisfy various different requirements. If it’s an Avant, it needs to be family-friendly with ample space for three kids on the rear seat. A sports car needs to have excellent driving dynamics. The concept for a vehicle is defined by requirements. And the requirements come from our customers.”</p>

			<h1>Focus on the customer</h1>
			<section id="left">
				<p>Thus the concept starts with the customer’s wishes. And in the case of the Audi e-tron GT quattro, they are as clear-cut as they are incompatible. Or at least, they have been until now. Plenty of customers want a vehicle that is beautiful, very sporty, fit for everyday use and sustainable. The challenge is that very sporty vehicles do not usually score highly on everyday usability. And if the focus shifts too much towards everyday usability, developers are inclined to create a purely functional vehicle that will then be less aerodynamic or sporty.</p>
				<p>But the future often makes things possible that were difficult to imagine in the past. That is where electric mobility steps into the role of enabler. Durst, who is effectively the project owner in defining the performance specifications for new vehicles, puts it like this: “With the electric platform as our basis, we can now bring together aspects of the vehicle architecture of the Audi e-tron GT that were previously incompatible.”</p>

			<h1>The electric vehicle concept</h1>
			<p>There is no ten-cylinder engine restricting the cabin. Instead, small electric motors on the axles permit an interior with abundant space for four passengers. The agility and surprising acceleration of the electric drive is combined with a high range, which also benefits from excellent aerodynamics. The absence of a combustion engine enables proportions that produce an exciting design.</p>
			<p>The result is a fully electric, four-door, driver-focused Gran Turismo with high-performance handling characteristics. “The Audi e-tron GT is the best example of how utterly contradictory requirements drive us further forward than we had ever imagined in our wildest dreams,” adds Durst.</p>

			<h1>Active aerodynamics improve range</h1>
			<section>
				<p>Dr. Moni Islam is standing in front of an oversized LED wall that displays an aerodynamics simulation of the Audi e-tron GT. He throws his arms wide open and follows the simulated airflow along the vehicle’s silhouette. Brimming with pride, he declares: “With the Audi e tron GT we’ve succeeded in blending fantastic design with very good aerodynamics.”</p>
				<p>The Canadian makes no secret of the huge challenge his specific discipline has faced: “For system reasons, electric vehicles can carry less energy on board in their battery than conventional vehicles have in their fuel tank. So we need to take special care when using that electrical energy. For us engineers, there’s a huge incentive to develop the best possible aerodynamics for all our electric models.”</p>
			</section>
			<img src="https://www.audi.com/content/dam/gbp2/company/sustainability/products-and-services/2021/the-masterpiece/Design_Islam_1920x1080.jpg?imwidth=942&imdensity=1" alt="another guy">
		</div>

		<div id="div-fourteen">
			<p>Every one-thousandth degree of improvement in the aerodynamics can extend the range. That is because aerodynamic drag is often the dominant component of road resistance for an electric vehicle when driven by the customer. At speeds beyond about 100 km/h, it already accounts for roughly half of total road resistance. At a steady 140 km/h, aerodynamic drag approximately doubles. That inflates energy consumption by around 50 percent.</p>

			<p class="caption">In combination, the vehicle details create a sculpture that looks like it was shaped by the wind. This is further underscored by styling with a high degree of aerodynamic quality. The drag coefficient amounts to only 0.24.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="div-seventeen">
			<h1>Levers for optimizing aerodynamics</h1>
			<p>But the electric vehicle concept is conducive to efficient aerodynamics. For example, the Audi e-tron GT has a completely enclosed underbody that is smooth from tip to tail. Such a design is only possible because the battery drive means there is no exhaust system. That already improves the airflow enormously. Also, the electric motors of the Audi e-tron GT operate much more efficiently than a combustion engine. They transmit less heat to the surroundings and cooling is needed much more rarely and to a lesser extent. That allows the aerodynamics engineers to employ intelligent cooling air management on the Audi e-tron GT.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="div-eighteen">
			<h1>The closable side cooling air inlets</h1>
			<p>“We’ve realized a raft of measures to manage the aerodynamics optimally on the Audi e-tron GT. First, the closable side cooling air inlets are a very important aerodynamic feature of the forward structure,” emphasizes Islam. “The louver system on these air inlets is controlled electronically and regulates automatically how much cooling air the vehicle needs. Depending on the driving profile, the louvers remain closed for much of the journey – that keeps the drag coefficient as low as possible.”</p>
		</div>

		<div id="div-ninteen">
			<h1>The extending rear spoiler</h1>
			<section>
				<img src="https://www.audi.com/content/dam/gbp2/company/sustainability/products-and-services/2021/the-masterpiece/Design_10_1920x1080.jpg?imwidth=942&imdensity=1" alt="spiler">
				<p class="caption">Fascinating effects thanks to technological innovation: active adjustment of aerodynamics by the rear spoiler adjustable in two stages.</p>
			</section>
			<span>Another innovation is the extending rear spoiler, which for the first time on an Audi has several positions to optimize the various driving modes. This means that in any driving mode the rear spoiler can adjust the direction of the airflow to produce the most appropriate aerodynamics. In eco mode, the slipstream is brought together as close to parallel and to the vehicle’s tail end as possible. The reason? The smaller this low-pressure zone at the rear, the lower the entire vehicle’s resistance. In the dynamic mode, the rear spoiler is angled much more steeply to reduce lift at the rear wheels to the minimum level required.</span>
		</div>

		<div id="div-twenty">
			<h1>The adaptive air suspension</h1>
			<span>The controllable features also include the adaptive air suspension. “Height adjustment is important for aerodynamic reasons. The lowest position, the setting for fast freeway driving, is ideal for the drag coefficient,” explains Islam. He then adds: “From an aerodynamics perspective, I don’t mind if the suspension setting is higher for everyday use in city driving. At those speeds, aerodynamics are barely relevant.”</span>

			<h2>“The Audi e-tron GT has an outstanding drag coefficient of 0.24. That’s the best drag coefficient to date of any of our electric models. Good aerodynamics are especially important for maximizing the electric range. But if performance is what you want, with very low lift for precision driving dynamics, the Audi e-tron GT can of course also deliver. The technology makes incredible aerodynamic breadth possible.”</h2>

		</div>

		<div id="div-twentytwo">
			<h1>Perfectly proportioned</h1>
			<p>Marc Lichte strides swiftly into the studio hall in which the Audi e-tron GT is waiting for the cameras to start rolling, and calls first: “So, is the suspension in the lowest position? That will show off its proportions much better!” Then Lichte simply can’t resist exclaiming: “Doesn’t that thing look just great? A vehicle with a battery in the underbody, a four-seater with plenty of rear headroom, even for tall people like me – but the Audi e-tron GT is still seven centimeters lower than the Audi A7. I always say: Proportions are the basis for good design. Always. And the package of the Audi e-tron GT creates those proportions – they are quite simply perfect.”</p>

		<div id="div-twentyfour">
			<h1>Audi e-design of the future</h1>
			<p>The Audi e-tron GT is the first series-production vehicle to display all the traits that Marc Lichte and his team define as the Audi e-design of the future. Such as the optically inverted Singleframe, which is finished in the body color with a dark surround. It declares from far off: This is an Audi. And – it is electric. Or take the expressive sill design, which very clearly indicates that this vehicle’s nerve center is no longer the engine under the hood, it is the battery beneath the floor. And above all the deep shoulder line, which instead of following the time-honored principle of continuing at one level is now interrupted in the middle, and uses soft lines to accentuate the muscles that define the vehicle silhouette at the front and rear – the so-called quattro muscles. Marc Lichte continues: “These wheel arches. These two muscles. That, for me, is Audi.”</p>

			<h1>Aerodynamics as a design feature</h1>
			<span>On the Audi e-tron GT the aerodynamics are also visibly expressed as an exterior design feature: by means of air inlets (air curtains) in the front, separating edges integrated into the rear lights, the diffuser at the tail end. But these features do not blatantly demand attention. According to Marc Lichte: “There are all kinds of ways you can express e-mobility in the design. Some electric cars seek to grab your attention. We take a different approach. You can clearly tell the Audi e-tron GT is an electric vehicle. We use the design to illustrate the drive system’s evolution. We believe electric mobility enables us to create the most beautiful cars in the world. That’s our ambition.”</span>

			</section>
			<span>The technical platform for electric cars now gives Audi designers the scope to craft the vehicle proportions they have always dreamed of. The motors on the axles and the battery between them, in the floor, mean the cabin that is at the heart of the structure can increase in size, pushing the larger wheels further out. Huge wheelbase, huge wheels, short overhangs. That is what defines the unique character of Audi electric vehicles. Marc Lichte cannot suppress his enthusiasm: “The Audi e-tron GT is easily the best car I’ve so far had the privilege to design. The car is like a sketch. It’s ultra-flat, has giant wheels and fabulously short overhangs. Ever since I started sketching cars as a small boy, I’ve been dreaming of creating a vehicle like this.”</span>
		</div>

		<div id="div-twentynine">
			<p>The fact that Lichte’s dream has become a reality specifically with the Audi e-tron GT, one of the most aerodynamic – and therefore efficient – Audi models of all time, highlights his expectations of every Audi: “A good design combines high aesthetic value with perfect function.” And as if he can barely believe it himself, Marc Lichte takes another walk around the Audi e-tron GT in the studio hall, stops, smiles and says quietly to himself: “The masterpiece.”</p>

			<p>* The specified fuel consumption and emission data have been determined according to the measurement procedures prescribed by law. Since 1st September 2017, certain new vehicles are already being type-approved according to the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP), a more realistic test procedure for measuring fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Starting on September 1st 2018, the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) will be replaced by the WLTP in stages. Owing to the more realistic test conditions, the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions measured according to the WLTP will, in many cases, be higher than those measured according to the NEDC. Therefore, the usage of CO2 emission values measured according to WLTP for vehicle taxation from 1st September 2018 on can cause changes in this regards as well. For further information on the differences between the WLTP and NEDC, please visit www.audi.de/wltp.</p>
			<p>We are currently still required by law to state the NEDC figures. In the case of new vehicles which have been type-approved according to the WLTP, the NEDC figures are derived from the WLTP data. It is possible to specify the WLTP figures voluntarily in addition until such time as this is required by law. In cases where the NEDC figures are specified as value ranges, these do not refer to a particular individual vehicle and do not constitute part of the sales offering. They are intended exclusively as a means of comparison between different vehicle types. Additional equipment and accessories (e.g. add-on parts, different tire formats, etc.) may change the relevant vehicle parameters, such as weight, rolling resistance and aerodynamics, and, in conjunction with weather and traffic conditions and individual driving style, may affect fuel consumption, electrical power consumption, CO2 emissions and the performance figures for the vehicle.</p>
			<p>Further information on official fuel consumption figures and the official specific CO2 emissions of new passenger cars can be found in the “Guide on the fuel economy, CO2 emissions and power consumption of new passenger car models”, which is available free of charge at all sales dealerships and from DAT Deutsche Automobil Treuhand GmbH, Hellmuth-Hirth-Str. 1, D-73760 Ostfildern, Germany and at www.dat.de.</p>
